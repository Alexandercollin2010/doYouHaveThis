Do You Have Something?
======================
Inventory project for tier 2 week 1 (js/html)
---------------------------------------------
Our client runs an oddities store.

Basic Features:
---------------
* handshake between js and html (sourcing inventory.js)
* get user selection on button click (onClick tag on button element in HTML that runs a function in JS)
* select size (select element with options within)
* select color (select element with options within)
* search by both size and color

Your challenge:
---------------
Recreate the above project. If time allows, try to incorporate the following:
* new item input from user input (stored in inventory array. Searchable)
* search by name
* add some styling

Make sure to push your work to Github when complete!

Good luck!
